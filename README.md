# Progress Indicator Component For Skuid

This is a modification of the progress indicator bult by Skuid in [this tutorial](http://help.skuid.com/m/11720/l/451511-progress-indicator-component)

##Key Upgrades
1) When using the picklist option, a secondary 'exclude' property category appears in the builder. In here, one can chose which values in the picklist should NOT render.
2) Skewed progress sections instead of the arrows found in the original.
